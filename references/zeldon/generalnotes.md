[Maker](https://makerdao.com/en/): https://github.com/makerdao
Maker is a stablecoin project where each stablecoin (called DAI) is pegged to the US Dollar and is backed by collateral in the form of crypto. Stablecoins offer the programmability of crypto without the downside of volatility that you see with “traditional” cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum.

[Oasis](https://oasis.app/borrow)
Create own DAI stable coin.

[Compound](https://compound.finance/)
is a blockchain-based borrowing and lending dapp — you can lend your crypto out and earn interest on it.

[LoanScan](https://loanscan.io/)
track borrow/lend interest rates across the various dapps, so you can shop around for the best rates.

[dharma](https://www.dharma.io/)
Dharma is a limitless, borderless way to send & receive USD — all while earning 1.4% APR.

[dydx](https://dydx.exchange/)
powerful open trading platform for crypto assets.

[UniSwap](https://uniswap.io/)
cryptocurrency exchange run entirely on smart contracts, letting you trade popular tokens directly from your wallet. This is different from an exchange like Coinbase, which stores your crypto for you and holds your private keys for safekeeping. Uniswap uses an innovative mechanism known as Automated Market Making to automatically settle trades near the market price. In addition to trading, any user can become a liquidity provider, by supplying crypto to the Uniswap contract and earning a share of the exchange fees. This is called “pooling”.

Other popular Decentralized Exchange platforms (DEXes) include 0x, <u>AirSwap</u>, <u>Bancor</u>, <u>Kyber</u>, <u>IDEX</u>, <u>Paradex</u> and <u>Radar</u> Relay. All have slightly different architectures.


[Synthetic](https://www.synthetix.io/)
a platform that lets users create and exchange synthetic versions of assets like gold, silver, cryptocurrencies and traditional currencies like the Euro. The synthetic assets are backed by excess collateral locked into the Synthetix contracts.

[pool together](https://www.pooltogether.com/)
is a no-loss game where participants deposit the DAI stablecoin into a common pot. At the end of each month, one lucky participant wins all the interest earned, and everyone gets their initial deposits back.

[Nexus Mutual](https://www.nexusmutual.io/)
decentralized insurance that would make users whole in the event of smart contract hacks.
